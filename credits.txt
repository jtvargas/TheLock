node-forge@1.3.1 ((BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0))

  You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
  GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.
  
  The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
  understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
  Forge project.
  
  If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
  that license.
  
  You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
  you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
  use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
  left intact.
  
  If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
  commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
  afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
  library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
  the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
  thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
  the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
  commercial entities for our efforts.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
             Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
            Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
  
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  
            NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  
     1. Definitions.
  
        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
  
        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  
        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
  
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
  
        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  2. License Grants and Conditions
  --------------------------------
  
  2.1. Grants
  
  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license:
  
  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
  Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
  modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
  Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
  as part of a Larger Work; and

  Contributions or its Contributor Version.
  
  2.2. Effective Date

  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.
  
  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
  
  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:
  
  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
  or
  
  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
  modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
  Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
  Version); or
  
  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
  its Contributions.
  
  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
  the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
  
  2.4. Subsequent Licenses
  
  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
  License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
  permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
  
  2.5. Representation
  
  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
  to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
  
  2.6. Fair Use
  
  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.
  
  2.7. Conditions
  
  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.
  
  3. Responsibilities
  -------------------
  
  3.1. Distribution of Source Form
  
  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
  the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
  Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
  License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
  attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
  Form.
  
  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
  
  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
  
  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
  Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
  the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
  Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
  than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
  
  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
  License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
  license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
  the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
  
  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
  
  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
  the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
  Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
  Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
  License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
  under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
  the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
  Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
  License(s).
  
  3.4. Notices
  
  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
  or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
  the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
  
  3.5. Application of Additional Terms
  
  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
  such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.
  
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
  ---------------------------------------------------
  
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
  the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
  be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
  Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
  or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
  
  5. Termination
  --------------
  
  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
  notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
  first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
  Your receipt of the notice.
  
  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
  counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
  You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
  2.1 of this License shall terminate.
  
  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.
  
  ************************************************************************
  * *
  * 6. Disclaimer of Warranty *
  * ------------------------- *
  * *
  * Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" *
  * basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or *
  * statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the *
  * Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a *
  * particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the *
  * quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. *
  * Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You *
  * (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, *
  * repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an *
  * essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is *
  * authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. *
  * *
  ************************************************************************
  
  ************************************************************************
  * *
  * 7. Limitation of Liability *
  * -------------------------- *
  * *
  * Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort *
  * (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any *
  * Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as *
  * permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, *
  * special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character *
  * including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of *
  * goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any *
  * and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party *
  * shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This *
  * limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or *
  * personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the *
  * extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some *
  * jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of *
  * incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and *
  * limitation may not apply to You. *
  * *
  ************************************************************************
  
  8. Litigation
  -------------
  
  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
  place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
  cross-claims or counter-claims.
  
  9. Miscellaneous
  ----------------
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
  that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
  shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
  
  10. Versions of the License
  ---------------------------
  
  10.1. New Versions
  
  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.
  
  10.2. Effect of New Versions
  
  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
  or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.
  
  10.3. Modified Versions
  
  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
  any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
  such modified license differs from this License).
  
  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses
  
  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
  notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
  
  Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

  License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
  file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
  
  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
  for such a notice.
  
  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  
     1. Definitions.
  
        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
  
        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  
        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
  
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

argparse@2.0.1 (Python-2.0)

  A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
  ==========================
  
  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
  Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
  as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
  principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
  
  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
  National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
  in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
  software.
  
  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
  BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
  year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
  Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
  https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
  created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
  Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
  
  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
  the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
  releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
  the various releases.
  
      Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                      from                                compatible? (1)
  
      0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
      1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
      1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
      2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
      1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
      2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
      2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
      2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
      2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
      2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
      2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
  
  Footnotes:
  
  (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
      the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
      a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
      GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
      other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
  
  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
      because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
      CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
      is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
  
  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
  direction to make these releases possible.

     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  
     1. Definitions.
  
        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
  
        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  
        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
  
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
  does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
  Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
  other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
  information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
  warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
  terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
  disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
  fullest extent possible.
  
  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
  
  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
  conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
  original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
  and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
  following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
  exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
  
       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
       intended for use by those authorized to give the public
       permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
       copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
       irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
       and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
       Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
       applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
       material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
       material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
       licensed material, or material used under an exception or
       limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
  
       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
       licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
       licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
       the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
       example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
       copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
       licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
       other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
       the licensed material may still be restricted for other
       reasons, including because others have copyright or other
       rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
       such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
       Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
       respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
       for the public: 
  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees

  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
  
  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
  to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
  Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the

       arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
       permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
       Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
       Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
       Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
       synched in timed relation with a moving image.
  
    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
       and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
       accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  
    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
       closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
       performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
       Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
       categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
       specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
       Rights.
  
    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
       absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
       fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
       Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
       agreements.
  
    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
       any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
       that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
  
    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
       or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
       License.

       terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
       all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
       Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
  
    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
       under this Public License.
  
    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
       process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
       as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
       dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
       available to the public including in ways that members of the
       public may access the material from a place and at a time
       individually chosen by them.
  
    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
       resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
       the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
       as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
       equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
  
    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
       under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
  
  
  Section 2 -- Scope.
  
    a. License grant.
  
         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
  
              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                 in part; and
  
              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
  
         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.
  
         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).
  
         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.
  
         5. Downstream recipients.
  
              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                 Public License.
  
              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                 Material.
  
         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  
    b. Other rights.
  
         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.
  
         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.
  
         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties.
  
  
  Section 3 -- License Conditions.
  
  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
  following conditions.
  
    a. Attribution.
  
         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:
  
              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                 with the Licensed Material:
  
                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                      Material and any others designated to receive
                      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                      the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                      designated);
  
                  ii. a copyright notice;
  
                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
  
                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                      warranties;
  
                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                      extent reasonably practicable;
  
              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
  
              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                 hyperlink to, this Public License.
  
         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
  
         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.
  
         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
            Material from complying with this Public License.
  
  
  Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
  
  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
  apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
  
    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
       to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
       portion of the contents of the database;
  
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
       contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
  
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
       all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
  
  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
  replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
  Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
  
  
  Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
  
    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
       EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
       AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
       ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
       IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
       ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
       KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
       ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
       TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
       COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
       USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
       DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
       IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
       above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
       possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
       waiver of all liability.
  
  
  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
  
    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
       Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
       this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
       terminate automatically.
  
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
       Section 6(a), it reinstates:
  
         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
            violation; or
  
         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
  
       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
       of this Public License.
  
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
       Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
       distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
       will not terminate this Public License.
  
    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
       License.
  
  
  Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
  
    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
       terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  
    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
       Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
       independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  
  
  Section 8 -- Interpretation.
  
    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
       shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
       conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
       be made without permission under this Public License.
  
    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
       deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
       cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
       without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
       conditions.
  
    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
       failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
       Licensor.
  
    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
       as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
       that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
       processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

                             Version 2.0, January 2004
                          http://www.apache.org/licenses/
  
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  
     1. Definitions.
  
        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
  
        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.
  
        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.
  
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.
  
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.
  
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
  
        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
        identification within third-party archives.

mdn-data@2.0.14 (CC0-1.0)

  CC0 1.0 Universal
  
  Statement of Purpose
  
  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
  exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
  subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
  authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
  
  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
  purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
  works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
  claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
  and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
  purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
  contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
  further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
  reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
  efforts of others.
  
  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
  of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
  Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
  and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
  and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
  Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
  effect of CC0 on those rights.
  
  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
  protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
  Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
  to, the following:
  
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;
  
    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  
    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;
  
    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
    a Work;
  
    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
  
    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
  
  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
  applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
  unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
  and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
  known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
  action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
  duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
  extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
  copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
  commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
  the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
  detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
  shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
  any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
  by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
  
  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
  judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
  shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
  Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
  is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
  non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
  unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
  the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
  provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
  purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
  promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
  of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
  License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
  applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
  invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
  affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
  Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
  and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
  Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
  
  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
  
    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  
    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
    of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
    other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  
    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
    any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
    or other rights required for any use of the Work.
  
    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
    CC0 or use of the Work.

  to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
  
  2.6. Fair Use
  
  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.
  
  2.7. Conditions
  
  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted

  3. Responsibilities
  -------------------
  
  3.1. Distribution of Source Form
  
  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
  the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
  Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
  License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
  attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
  Form.
  
  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
  
  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
  
  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
  Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
  the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
  Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
  than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
  
  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
  License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
  license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
  the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
  
  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
  
  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
  the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
  Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
  Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
  License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
  under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
  the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
  Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
  License(s).
  
  3.4. Notices
  
  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
  or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
  the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
  
  3.5. Application of Additional Terms
  
  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
  such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.
  
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
  ---------------------------------------------------
  
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
  the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
  be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
  Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
  or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
  
  5. Termination
  --------------
  
  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
  notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
  first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
  Your receipt of the notice.
  
  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
  counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
  You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
  2.1 of this License shall terminate.
  
  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.

  * 6. Disclaimer of Warranty *
  * ------------------------- *
  * *
  * Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" *
  * basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or *
  * statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the *
  * Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a *
  * particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the *
  * quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. *
  * Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You *
  * (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, *
  * repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an *
  * essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is *
  * authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. *
  * *
  ************************************************************************
  
  ************************************************************************
  * *
  * 7. Limitation of Liability *
  * -------------------------- *
  * *
  * Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort *
  * (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any *
  * Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as *
  * permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, *
  * special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character *
  * including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of *
  * goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any *
  * and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party *
  * shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This *
  * limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or *
  * personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the *
  * extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some *
  * jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of *
  * incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and *
  * limitation may not apply to You. *
  * *
  ************************************************************************
  
  8. Litigation
  -------------
  
  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
  place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
  cross-claims or counter-claims.
  
  9. Miscellaneous
  ----------------
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
  that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
  shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
  
  10. Versions of the License
  ---------------------------
  
  10.1. New Versions
  
  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.
  
  10.2. Effect of New Versions
  
  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
  or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.
  
  10.3. Modified Versions
  
  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
  any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
  such modified license differs from this License).
  
  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses
  
  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
